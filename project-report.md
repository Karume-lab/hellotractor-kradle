## Key Features:

1. **Adding Tractors and Attachments to Sell (Buyer)**:
   - Buyers can easily add tractors and attachments they wish to sell by filling out a detailed form with relevant information such as price, condition, and specifications. The process is intuitive, allowing buyers to upload images and descriptions for their listings.

2. **Listing Tractors and Attachments for Sellers**:
   - Sellers can view listings created by buyers and have access to detailed product pages that include specifications, prices, and images. Sellers can evaluate whether to make offers or request more information about the listings.

3. **In-App Messaging**:
   - The platform includes a secure, real-time messaging system that enables buyers and sellers to communicate directly within the app. This feature ensures that all transactions and negotiations are managed in a centralized, secure manner.

4. **Admin Approval of Listings**:
   - All tractor and attachment listings submitted by buyers must undergo admin approval before being made publicly visible. This ensures that only legitimate, verified products are listed on the platform, maintaining the integrity and quality of the marketplace.

5. **Secure Authentication and Different User Roles**:
   - The app incorporates secure authentication methods, allowing users to sign up and log in with strong password protection. Different user roles are implemented, including buyers, sellers, and admins. Each role has distinct permissions and access, ensuring secure and customized interactions based on the user type.

6. **Admin Panel**:
   - The admin panel provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage user roles, approve or reject listings, and oversee platform activity. Admins can monitor all transactions, view messaging histories, and ensure the smooth functioning of the marketplace.


## Challenges:

1. **Time Constraints**:
   - One of the major challenges faced during the project was managing time effectively, especially when working under tight deadlines. Balancing tasks such as feature implementation, debugging, and testing, while also ensuring smooth collaboration between team members, required careful planning and prioritization of tasks. This was particularly challenging when facing unexpected issues or delays in certain parts of the project, such as integrating search and filtering effectively and the admin approval workflow.

2. **Learning New Technologies**:
   - As a team, we encountered several technologies and tools that were new to us. For example, integrating the authentication system securely with different user roles was a learning curve, as well as understanding the complexities of admin approval workflows. Additionally, implementing real-time messaging functionality required learning about websockets and handling asynchronous data, which was unfamiliar territory for some team members. Learning how to use these technologies effectively under time pressure was challenging but ultimately rewarding.

3. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Debugging complex interactions between the buyer, seller, and admin workflows was another major challenge. Ensuring that all features (e.g., secure authentication, listing approval, messaging) worked seamlessly required thorough testing, which often revealed unexpected bugs or edge cases that needed to be addressed. Testing real-time features like messaging and ensuring everything was fully functional across various devices added to the challenge.


Despite these challenges, they provided valuable learning experiences, and overcoming them contributed greatly to the successful completion of the project.


## Lessons Learned:

Throughout the project, we learned the importance of effective time management and communication within a team. Balancing technical implementation with deadlines taught us to prioritize tasks and collaborate efficiently. We also gained valuable experience in working with new technologies, such as secure authentication and real-time messaging, which deepened our understanding of web development. Additionally, we learned the significance of thorough testing and handling edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience. Most importantly, we recognized the need for scalability and forward-thinking when designing features to accommodate future growth.

## Future Features:

Looking ahead, we plan to enhance the platform by adding several key features to improve user experience and functionality:

1. **Search and Filter:**  
   Users will be able to easily search and filter through tractors and attachments based on various criteria such as price, location, condition, fuel capacity, and more. This will allow both buyers and sellers to find the equipment that best matches their needs quickly and efficiently.

2. **Comparison of Equipment:**  
   To help users make more informed decisions, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to compare multiple pieces of equipment side-by-side. This will include key specifications, price comparisons, and other relevant details, making it easier for buyers to evaluate their options before making a purchase.

3. **A more personalized and brand-centric user interface**
